HW4-Problem-1
=============

<p>
Use Sage to investigate the following problem in number theory. *
Let f(x)=x^2 + a*x + b be a quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients, for example, f(x) = x^2+x+6. 
Formulate a conjecture about when the set {f(n) : n in Z and f(n) is prime} is infinite. 
(NOTE: It is an open problem to prove anything in this direction, so you probably shouldn't try. 
For example x^2+1 is conjectured to be prime infinitely often, but nobody has a proof. Just make a conjecture.)
